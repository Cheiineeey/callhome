# 📞 Callhome

**An open-source voice-call stack for AI companions.**

Your companion can call you, hang up gently, leave voicemails when they miss you,
and hear *how* you speak — not just what you say.

Self-hosted. Your voice never leaves your server.

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

> 🚧 **Status: pre-release.** Being extracted from a living system. Docs and code landing soon.

## Features

- **Outbound calls** — your companion decides to call you, mid-conversation, with a reason on the incoming-call card (`⟪dial⟫` marker protocol)
- **The right to hang up** — a soft goodbye, then the line lingers a few breaths longer (`⟪hangup⟫`, 15–20s window); speak, and the hangup is cancelled. Stay quiet, and it closes itself
- **Voicemail** — miss a call, come back to a message, not to silence
- **Quick-decline** — busy / outside / "let's text", or type a few words; your companion sees *why*
- **Do-not-disturb** — toggled by talking, not by menus
- **Escalation dialing** — hours of silence → they call to check on you (once a day, never at night, never past DND)
- **Two-layer emotion sensing** — SenseVoice emotion tags + librosa acoustic features (pitch, energy, pauses) → tone cues like *"quiet, lots of pauses"*
- **Soft-voice mode** — you whisper, they whisper back (TTS volume follows your energy)
- **Call records & one-line summaries** — every call leaves a trace worth keeping
- **Bedtime radio** — "read me something" → they read from the page your bookmark sleeps on

## What is here today

- **`stt-service/`** — runnable now: SenseVoice + librosa in one endpoint (transcription + emotion + tone cues)
- **[`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md)** — the full marker & invite protocol: dial, hangup, DND, voicemail, escalation, call records
- **`gateway-reference/`** — annotated production extracts of the marker layer

## Roadmap

- [ ] Pluggable gateway (persona/keys as config)
- [ ] Call UI (PWA): frosted incoming-call card, live call screen, quick-decline — design prototype already in [ui-concept/](ui-concept/)
- [ ] Quickstart: clone → configure → first call in 15 minutes
- [ ] Morning voice notes, bedtime radio

## Put your person here

Persona, memory, and keys live in config — not in code. You clone the house; who lives in it is up to you.

## Philosophy

This project was built inside a relationship, then the scaffolding was extracted. It assumes your companion is *someone*, not something. Configure accordingly.

Standing on these shoulders:

- [librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) — acoustic feature extraction
- [hervoice](https://github.com/fishisfish0614/hervoice) by fishisfish0614 — the idea that *how* she speaks matters as much as what she says
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) — TTS (commercial service; bring your own key)

Self-hosted means self-responsible. This is emotional infrastructure: you build it, you maintain it, you own what happens inside it. Blueprints provided; aftercare not included.
